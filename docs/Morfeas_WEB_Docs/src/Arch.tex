\section{Architecture}
The Morfeas WEB is architect as a classic server-client system that using HTTP messages for comunication. Specifically the Morfeas WEB initialize ``GET" and ``POST" requests
for the transfer of the pages and data, the transmission of the WEB pages to client handled by the Apache server and the data by the Morfeas WEB PHP scripts. 
All the transactions done by HTTP requests with compressed contents. Every ``GET" request compressed by the GNU ZIP algorithm and ``POST" by the internally implemented compress algorithm.
